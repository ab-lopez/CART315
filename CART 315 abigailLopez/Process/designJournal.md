# Design Journal - CART 315

## Week 4
### Suika Game Analysis
- Things that make the game interesting for me is how slow the game is. A lot relies on physics and the fruits slowly rolling and falling and tipping over each other, and I find myself holding my breath to see if the fruits fall over on a way that I want.
- the domino effect is really satisfying to watch happen
- effects when you reach the goal of the game (making a watermelon) spark a lot of joy, especially because they’re so sudden
- i’ve been playing this game on and off for a while now, but I’m unsure about what the number values in the legend of the right side of the web build browser mean. Does it calculate the score of fruits already on the screen? Is it cumulative? It’s unclear.
    - I think a clearer legend would be helpful for players.
- UI is intuitive, multiple ways of dropping the fruit based on user preference (although I didn’t realize that when first playing the game and found that my initial pressing+sliding on my trackpad tactic was unintuitive and difficult)

## Week 7
### Ideation:
- Word-dumping ideation session in class reminds me of a similar ideation technique employed by one of my favourite comic artists (Gabby Capili). Quick word association is an easy way to figure out what themes/images/stories/etc. connect and resonate with you.
- My ideation process led to me coming up with some of the same motifs I had seen in my recent body of work: fish, fishing, marine life, conservation, isolation, lighthouses and haunted houses. Food, connection, antagonization. Doomed relationships, cycles of abuse, generational trauma, time loops. Absence and intangibility vs. Presence and realness. I see a lot of patterns in things that I make.
- Using these as a jumping off point for game inspiration, I came up with the following ideas:
    - Combo fishing/fighting game (I like fish)
    - Combo cooking/fighting game (I like cooking games)
    - Suburban nuclear family simulator management game in which the family is toxic and will literally explode when the player loses (I like puns)
- Settle on the fact that the last is probably the most realistic for me to be able to make and also probably the least derivative

### Design Values:
- Games where the mechanics hold narrative and thematic importance. I want the mechanics to evoke the feeling of whatever my game ends up becoming
- Narrative: I like keeping narratives in mind when making any art
- Diversity: I like making things that do not tone itself down, things that are accommodating for diverse audiences without making it palatable or easily consumable.

## Week 8
### Exploratory Prototype Stage 1:
- Decided to go with an adapted version of the nuclear family sim management game, was worried that the mechanics I was thinking about was not interesting or fun enough to play + was worried that more than two characters would get overwhelming for me to code for.
- Abbreviated version: I wanted to do a dating sim/management game, but still maintaining the feeling of toxic, tense relationships that have to continuously be managed/manipulated, with threat of a blow up at all times. Wanted to draw inspiration from TTRPGs like Star Crossed by Alex Roberts and Dread by Epidiah Ravachol, games with a ticking time bomb.
- For the narrative, decided to go with a dating sim between two representatives of conflicting factions.
- Thus the questions:
    - How do I create mechanics that feel thematically/narratively relevant to the story? Mechanics that simultaneously feel like manipulating someone/managing+discovering where you stand in a new relationship/choosing between love + mutual peace + ”winning”?
    - Is this fun?
- Ended up with an implementation prototype of the game made with cards – medium fidelity because I spent a lot of time thinking about the mechanics (player/s play one card each turn, choosing between developing love+mutual peace+winning the conflict), but not fully set in stone
- What I learned:
    - Might’ve leaned too hard into my TTRPG tendencies. Would it make sense for me to make it a video game? What skills do I want to develop in making this final product.
    - The game can potentially infinitely loop due to a certain mechanic. Might need to adjust some mechanics before the next playtest.

## Week 9
### Exploratory Prototype Stage 2:
- Narrative/thematic questions: with TTRPGs it allows for players to define the story world’s parameters, video games need to do that work for the player. What story world’s are interesting to explore in the context of queerness, tension, transgressing vs. breaking boundaries, etc.? What story worlds should provide the flavour for this game?
- Story worlds with defined “political” boundaries (in the sense that there are forces outside of the characters causing the tension) that are interesting to me:
    - High society, monarchs/political leaders of opposing nations
    - Spies
    - I don’t know. It’s hard to come up with story worlds when the only premise you need is from being opposite sides of a singular conflict.
    - Space rebels against a galactic empire
    -  Members of rival gangs (bootleggers, fantastical (see: the classic vampires vs. werewolves – where does that archetypal tension even come from?), greasers, etc.)
    - girl pop stars who hate each other (the other story worlds have their lives/the communities they come from on the line, but is career a fun/interesting thing to be on the line? identity? there’s also a certain degree of performance that I imagine is thematically relevant in the other story worlds but this one especially when the characters ARE performers.)
- This week’s sketches exploring character possibilities:

## Week 10
### Iterative Prototype Stage 1:
- Mostly more visdev exploratory stuff. Having landed on spies as the driving character world, more sketches to develop what these characters look like/feel like/do + who they are.
- the red and green make me go ohhhhhh what if I fully leant into the wong kar wai in the mood for love colour keys of it all……
- figuring out a feel for the hypothetical UI and trying to visually translate the card mechanics into game mechanics
    - lots of stat bars, figuring out like a visual novel-esque expression changing based on the dialogue...
- caught on the question of: is it too complicated for me with my current capabilities + time left in the semester to code? Am I able to actually do this, or would it be better to try and simplify what I have? Might need to adjust mechanics in order to make it easier/quicker to prototype – can focus on complications from there.
    - on a tangent that means nothing to no one reading this besides myself: desperately need to call aaron sometime soon to talk this over. his is the only brain i trust when talking about games and their mechanics. hopefully sometime during the next iteration cycle (please please please please please)

## Week ???
### Crisis of Faith
- Is any of this fun at all.
- Started coding this week and is this fun at all. all this is is buttons and numbers going up
- I don't think translating a card game prototype into a video game is a spectacular idea
- Will probably take a hard shift into straight romance because that is what is currently missing from my prototype. It's a dating game without dating aka a bunch of buttons.
- Aaron (third party friend, trusted advisor, non-Concordia student, hopefully unbiased) thinks the mechanics are fine but this isn't a game at this point this is baby's-first-point-and-click-and-watch-numbers-happen
