## Suika Game Analysis
- Things that make the game interesting for me is how slow the game is. A lot relies on physics and the fruits slowly rolling and falling and tipping over each other, and I find myself holding my breath to see if the fruits fall over on a way that I want.
- the domino effect is really satisfying to watch happen
- effects when you reach the goal of the game (making a watermelon) spark a lot of joy, especially because they’re so sudden
- i’ve been playing this game on and off for a while now, but I’m unsure about what the number values in the legend of the right side of the web build browser mean. Does it calculate the score of fruits already on the screen? Is it cumulative? It’s unclear.
    - I think a clearer legend would be helpful for players.
- UI is intuitive, multiple ways of dropping the fruit based on user preference (although I didn’t realize that when first playing the game and found that my initial pressing+sliding on my trackpad tactic was unintuitive and difficult)
